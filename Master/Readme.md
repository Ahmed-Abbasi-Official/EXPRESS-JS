# Express Flash Messages Example and Flash Message

This project demonstrates how to implement and use flash messages in an Express.js application. Flash messages provide immediate feedback to users about the results of their actions.

## Features

- **Flash Messages**: Provide temporary notifications to users regarding the outcome of their actions or interactions within the application.
- **Express.js**: A popular web application framework for Node.js, facilitating robust server-side functionality.
- **Sessions**: Manage user sessions using `express-session` to track user state and data.
- **Flash Middleware**: Utilize `connect-flash` to create and manage flash messages that inform users about successes, errors, or other important information.
